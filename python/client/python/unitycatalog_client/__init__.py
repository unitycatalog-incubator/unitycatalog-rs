"""Unity Catalog Python client.

The public API lives in the compiled extension :mod:`unitycatalog_client._client`;
this package re-exports each symbol explicitly (using the PEP 484
``from X import Foo as Foo`` form) so static type checkers see a clean,
fully-typed public surface. The :file:`_client.pyi` stub describes the
compiled module — codegen emits the proto-derived bulk, and the
``just generate-code`` recipe appends the hand-written supplement
(``python/client/_client_supplement.pyi``) covering the exception
classes, ``parse_uc_url``, and the ergonomic
``TemporaryCredentialClient.temporary_*_credential`` methods.

The list of re-exports below mirrors the symbols actually registered
on the ``_client`` PyO3 module (see ``python/client/src/lib.rs`` plus
the exception/free-function registrations in ``error.rs`` /
``reference.rs``). When adding a new ``m.add_class::<...>()`` or
``create_exception!``, add the matching ``from ._client import Foo as
Foo`` line below.

Optional integrations live in submodules and may require extras:

* :mod:`unitycatalog_client.obstore` — install with
  ``pip install unitycatalog-client[obstore]`` to build native
  `obstore <https://developmentseed.org/obstore/>`_ stores backed by
  Unity Catalog credential vending.

# ``parse_uc_url`` is intentionally not re-exported at the package
# root: it is an internal URL parser shared with the obstore
# dispatchers. Import it from :mod:`unitycatalog_client._client` if
# you need it directly.
#
# No ``__all__``: every public name above uses the PEP 484
# ``import Foo as Foo`` form, which is sufficient for both static type
# checkers and for ``from unitycatalog_client import Foo`` at runtime.
