title: Ecosystem Overview
---

The Open Lakehouse ecosystem is not a strict set of libraries or services,
but rather we aim to provide a place to find, try, and learn about the open
lakehouse ecosystem.

Since the current authors have their roots in the delta lake project, this
site will for a while contain more information about delta lake and the delta
ecosystem.
