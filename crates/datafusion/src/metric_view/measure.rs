//! The `MEASURE()` marker aggregate function.
//!
//! A query against a metric view references a measure by wrapping the measure's
//! name in `MEASURE(...)`, e.g.
//!
//! ```sql
//! SELECT order_date, MEASURE(total_revenue)
//! FROM mv
//! GROUP BY order_date
//! ```
//!
//! `MEASURE` is registered as an aggregate UDF purely so that such a query
//! *plans* — the SQL planner accepts it in the select list alongside a
//! `GROUP BY`, and `total_revenue` resolves against the metric view's declared
//! schema. It is a **marker only**: [`ResolveMetricView`] rewrites every
//! `MEASURE(measure_col)` into the measure's real aggregate expression before
//! execution, so the accumulator below is never actually run. This mirrors
//! Spark's `Measure` placeholder resolved by `ResolveMetricView`.
//!
//! [`ResolveMetricView`]: super::analyzer::ResolveMetricView
