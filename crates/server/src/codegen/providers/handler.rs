// @generated — do not edit by hand.
//! Handler trait for [`ProviderHandler`].
//!
//! Implement this trait to provide a custom backend for this service.
//! Register your implementation with the generated route setup functions.
//!
//! # Composability
//!
//! A single struct can implement multiple handler traits to serve multiple
//! services. Use [`axum::Router::merge`] to compose routers together.
//!
//! Providers
//!
//! A provider represents an organization that shares data with this metastore.
//! It is the inbound counterpart of a recipient: registered from a share
//! activation/credential file and used to access shares offered by an upstream
//! Delta Sharing server.
