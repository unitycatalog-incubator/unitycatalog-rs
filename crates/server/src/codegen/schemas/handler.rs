// @generated — do not edit by hand.
//! Handler trait for [`SchemaHandler`].
//!
//! Implement this trait to provide a custom backend for this service.
//! Register your implementation with the generated route setup functions.
//!
//! # Composability
//!
//! A single struct can implement multiple handler traits to serve multiple
//! services. Use [`axum::Router::merge`] to compose routers together.
//!
//! A schema (also called a database) is the second layer of Unity Catalog’s three-level namespace.
//! A schema organizes tables, views and functions. To access (or list) a table or view in a schema,
//! users must have the USE_SCHEMA data permission on the schema and its parent catalog, and they must
//! have the SELECT permission on the table or view.
