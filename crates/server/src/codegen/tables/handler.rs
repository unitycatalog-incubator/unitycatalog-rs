//! Implement this trait to provide a custom backend for this service.
//! Register your implementation with the generated route setup functions.

//! # Composability
//!
//! A single struct can implement multiple handler traits to serve multiple

//!
//! Service for managing tables in Unity Catalog.
//! Tables represent structured data stored in a schema, supporting managed and external storage formats.
