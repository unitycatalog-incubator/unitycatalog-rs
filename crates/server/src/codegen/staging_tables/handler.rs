// @generated — do not edit by hand.
//! Handler trait for [`StagingTableHandler`].
//!
//! Implement this trait to provide a custom backend for this service, then mount the
//! generated handler functions (in the sibling `server` module) onto an `axum::Router`
//! with your implementation as state.
//!
//! # Composability
//!
//! A single struct can implement multiple handler traits to serve multiple
//! services. Use [`axum::Router::merge`] to compose per-service routers together.
//!
//! A staging table reserves an id and storage location for a Unity Catalog
//! managed table. After creating one, the client writes the initial Delta commit
//! at the returned staging_location and finalizes the table via CreateTable.
