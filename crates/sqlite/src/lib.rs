//! Embedded, file-based SQLite backend for the Unity Catalog server.
//!
//! This crate mirrors [`unitycatalog-postgres`](../unitycatalog_postgres) but
//! targets an in-process SQLite database, so a durable Unity Catalog server can
//! run from a single binary with zero external infrastructure.
//!
//! It implements the generic [`olai_store::ObjectStore`] /
//! [`olai_store::AssociationStore`] traits (over the project's `ObjectLabel`),
//! which the blanket `ObjectStoreAdapter` in `unitycatalog-common` lifts to the
//! high-level `ResourceStore` API, plus the `SecretManager` trait for sealed
//! secrets at rest and the `CommitCoordinator` trait for durable Delta
//! catalog-managed commits.
//!
//! ## Known gaps relative to the Postgres backend
//!
//! - **ASCII-only case-insensitivity.** Object names use SQLite's built-in
//!   `NOCASE` collation, which folds case for ASCII only. Postgres uses an ICU
//!   `case_insensitive` collation. Unicode-cased duplicate names that Postgres
//!   would reject may both be accepted here.
